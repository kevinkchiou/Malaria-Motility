plot_circ_probdistfcn() subroutine creates probability distribution / density functions of sporozoite tracks. It requires five other subroutines included here to handle 1) tracks that are not completely contiguous (contiguous() and contiguous_track_stats()), 2) computation of a subset of track statistics including track radius and curvature (compute_domega_dt() and circle_fit()), and 3) consistent data aggregation between like tracks (aggregate_circ_data()). The data structure format is detailed in import_csv_tracks() subroutine.

The complexity of the data structure import and handling arises due to variable organization / output from tracking software. Complications such as noncontiguous tracks, specifics of csv format, as well as variable order of the spatial (x,y,z) dimensions.
